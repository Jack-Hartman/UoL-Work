Scaleable Database Systems Assignment 1
A parcel delivery company wishes to build a system to track its vehicles and drivers throughout
the working day, i.e. from 8.00 am to 4:00 pm. The company has fitted each of its vehicles with a
GPS tracking device which will send the data to a database hosted on a cloud system.
You are required to design and implement a MySQL database schema to be used to store
relevant data from these GPS devices. At the start of any day’s work drivers use whatever
vehicle is assigned to them by the company. Drivers work on shift basis so a morning shift is
from 8:00 am to 11:55 am and an afternoon shift is from 12:00 noon to 4:00 pm.
Requirements:
1. Create a database with all appropriate tables, constraints, and relationships.
2. The database should be normalised, at least to 2NF.
3. Populate and add records to the tables.
 Assume you have 10 drivers and 5 vehicles. Assume data records are entered for
 one week.
4. A number of SQL queries should be defined to analyse vehicle, driver, and parcel
 movements. These queries are:
4.1. The location of any vehicle and its driver at any hour during the working
day.
4.2. Number of parcels delivered by any specific driver during a day’s work.
4.3. A listing of all drivers.
4.4. A listing of drivers who have driven only during morning hours shifts.
5. Choose any two queries from the above and implement them as Procedures.
6. To document your work, write and submit a report that describes how your
 database system works. The report should include:
6.1. an overview of the design process.
6.2. a schematic/diagram of the tables and their relationships.
6.3. a listing of the queries, i.e. the SQL syntax for each query, AND their
outputs.
6.4. anything else seen as relevant.
You must implement your final database solution, via an SQL script, using the phpMyAdmin and
MySQL database platform. In terms of deployment of the SQL script, your solution must only be
implemented and deployed with the tools given to you through the delivery team.
Your SQL script for this task should include MySQL DDL code for creating your final database
solution on your phpMyAdmin.
